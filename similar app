App2: shutterbite
 
Shutterbite is a food journal app that uses an alternate approach to calorie counting. Instead of focusing on the calories that you eat we help you to find the reason. This approach to meal tracking is designed to help with issues such as emotional eating, binge eating, and mindless eating.
By becoming fully mindful and eating when you are truly hungry and also stop eating when you are full, Shutterbite helps you to build a better relationship with food.
